# Welcome to our ReactJS bootcamp!

Hi! We feel overwhelmingly happy to see so many of you interested in our ReactJS bootcamp. We hope that you can learn a lot from our team. Please read the following instructions to proceed with our ReactJS bootcamp enrollment.

# First things first, let us get to know you!

We are eager to find excellent people to work with. Enthusiasm, positivity, cleverness, and passion are some of the traits we are looking for to join our engineering teams. We would like to ask you to do a quick video describing yourself, let us know of your challenges and achievements as a developer/IT enthusiast. You can record it from your mobile/computer, and it should take under 10 minutes.

# Sharing your video

Once you have your video ready please share it to Jose Melendez at Jose.Melendez@focusservices.com so we can continue with the process.
